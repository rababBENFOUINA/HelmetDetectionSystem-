HelmetDetectionSystem is an application designed to detect whether motorcyclists are wearing helmets at traffic lights. The system uses a camera to capture video footage of motorcyclists and employs a YOLO-trained model to identify those not wearing helmets. The application then sends the images of helmetless motorcyclists to another module responsible for facial recognition, which identifies the individuals. Subsequently, a fine is recorded for the identified person, and an email is sent to inform them of the violation.
